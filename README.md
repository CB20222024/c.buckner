This is my base repo for any spare code or personal projects that I may have. This repository was created for a course in my degree path.

I am an Information Technology major and I am minoring in Computer Networking with a concentration in Cybersecurity. 
I am hoping to graduate in the Spring of 2026.

I do not have much experience outside of my courses in coding. 
I am currently working on a website development project for ITE452.
